# awstoe-container
A container for awstoe to enable local and ci driven development of EC2 Image Builder Pipeline builds

## What is AWSTOE
If you want to build and test EC2 Images locally you must use AWSTOE.  AWS's documentation is found at [Develop Image Builder components locally](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/imagebuilder/latest/userguide/image-builder-component-manager-local.html#image-builder-component-manager-commands)

## Why all of this?
In order to enable development, there are several containers built to aid users in local development
